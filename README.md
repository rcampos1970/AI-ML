## Basic Concepts
### Main Types of Machine Learning

- Supervised/Unsupervised Learning 
- Batch and Online Learning
- Instance-Based Versus Model-Based Learning

### Main Problems in Machine Learning

- Insufficient Quantity of Training Data
- Nonrepresentative Training Data
- Poor-Quality Data
- Irrelevant Features
- Overfitting the Training Data
- Underfitting the Training Data

### Final Parts of Machine Learning
- Testing and Validating
- Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Selection

## Models
### Convolutional Neural Network
 A model used for complicated operations, specially in supervised learning (best at image recognition)
### Reinforcement Learning
A model based on agent, enviroment and rewards/punishment
### Convolutional Neural Network and RNN
A model used for complicated operations, specially in supervised learning (best at Natural Language Processing)
### Regressions (Linear, SVM, Polynomial, Random Forest)
A model for predictions
### Clustering
A model for splitting data into categories
